Magic Sparkle Prompt Engine transforms your short LLM prompts into comprehensive, expert-level instructions — instantly, privately, and with zero effort.

Type a short prompt like "fix this bug" on ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Click the sparkle button (or press Alt+S). Magic Sparkle enriches your prompt with page context, expert personas, and structured reasoning — then injects it back into the input.

Features:
- Smart detection of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini platforms
- Context heatmap: glowing border shows context readiness
- Expert persona assignment based on page type (GitHub, arXiv, Jira, StackOverflow, docs)
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning wrapper for better LLM responses
- Shadow DOM isolation — no CSS interference with host sites
- Keyboard shortcut: Alt+S
- All processing under 500ms, entirely local

Privacy:
All processing happens on your device. No data is collected, transmitted, or stored. No accounts. No analytics. Full privacy policy: https://github.com/smirk-dev/prompt-enhancer/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md
