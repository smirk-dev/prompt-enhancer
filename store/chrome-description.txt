Magic Sparkle Prompt Engine transforms your short LLM prompts into comprehensive, expert-level instructions — instantly, privately, and with zero effort.

HOW IT WORKS

Type a short prompt like "fix this bug" on ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Click the sparkle button (or press Alt+S). Magic Sparkle will:

1. Detect which LLM platform you're using
2. Scrape relevant context from the current page (title, URL, code blocks, headings)
3. Assign an expert persona based on the page context (Software Engineer for GitHub, Researcher for arXiv, etc.)
4. Wrap your prompt with Chain-of-Thought reasoning instructions
5. Inject the enriched prompt back into the text input

The result: 5x+ longer, context-rich prompts that get dramatically better first-shot responses.
